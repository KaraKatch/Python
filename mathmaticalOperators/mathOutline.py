#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

var = "Kara" + " Katch"
print(var)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 6 + 12
print(x)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y = 4 - 2
print(y)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

z = 3.5 - 1.2
print(z)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

r = 4 * 6
print(r)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

t = "hi" * 4
print(t)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

f = 6 / 3
print(f)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

l = 4.8 / 2.3
print(l)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

a = 8 % 4
print(a)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

c = 6 // 4
print(c)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

q = 3 ** 4
print(q)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

n = "fun " 4
print(n)
