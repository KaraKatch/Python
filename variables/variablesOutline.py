from builtins import True, False

#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#Integer

a = 5
a = 4

#Float

a = 3.45
a = 2.1

#String

a = "string"
name = "Kara"

#Boolean

a = True
a = False

#List 

a = [3, 4, 5]

a = ["StringOne", "StringTwo"]

a = [True, False]

a = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

a = 1
A = 4.6

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
 
 c = 12
 
 c = 4.8

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

q = A 

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

list = [a, q, c]

print = (list[1])

ListVar = list[1]
print(ListVar)

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

string = "Kara"

print(string[0])

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(A)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors

= 4

l == 12
