#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

v = ("carrot" == "grapes")
print(v)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

w = (6 == 6)
print(w)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x = (7 > 4)
print(x)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

z = (12 < 10)
print(z)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

a = (2 >= 2)
print(a)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

b = (4 <= 2)
print(b)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
